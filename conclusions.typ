In our work, we showed how the process of fuzz testing mobile application using QR codes described in @carboni2023if can be improved. Our contribution is about the complete virtualization of the testing process, making it significantly more scalable and efficient.
Previously, fuzz testing mobile applications with QR codes has been performed by relying on physical devices, which pose several challenges such as difficult setup process, camera overheating issues, and scalability issues. By virtualizing the testing environment, we effectively eliminated these critical aspects.

Overall, our approach to virtualizing the fuzz testing process not only addressed the critical issues associated with physical devices but also significantly enhanced the scalability, efficiency, and effectiveness of QR fuzz testing enabling researchers and developers to conduct tests at scale.
